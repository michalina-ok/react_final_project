        <h4>A good alternative?</h4>
        <p>
          If every email sent required just 4 minutes to create and 4 mins to write, the annual amount of C02 created by emails globally would be 150 million tonnes. At 0.3% of the world&apos;s carbon foot print this is an excellent alternative to
          physical mail which creates 20 times as much C02.

        <h4>Careless communication</h4>
        <p>
          A problem occurs however, when this type of efficiency is used to excess and with carelessness. Since 2017 the amount of emails sent and received daily has steadily increased and is predicted to rise from 269 billion to 376.4 billion in
          2025.

        <p>In the Uk alone for example it has been estimated that unnecessary “Thank-you” alone create the equivalent of 81,152 flights from Heathrow to Madrid.</p>

        <h4>What&apos;s the solution?</h4>
        <p>
          The best way to avoid unnecessary emails, is to unsubscribe to mailing lists you don&apos;t need to be on. Brands use emails to market their products and send a recommended 3-5 emails a week to thousands of customers, often with high
          quality images which can be the cause up to 50g of C02 emissions per customer

        <h4>Small changes</h4>
        <p>
          By making small changes such as deleting your old emails, being concise, keeping your mailing list up to date, and only sending emails to the people who need the information you can do you part in combatting excessive C02 emissions from
          emails and keep the planet a little bit greener.
